#Dynanimator
An animation package for the Dynamo visual programming environment, developed as part of the [Dynamo Hackathon](https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/autodesk-university-2014-dynamo-hackathon) at [Autodesk University 2014](http://au.autodesk.com).

##Project Goals
This package was developed for animating several aspects of a Revit model:
- Element parameters [done]
- Element transparency [done]
- Element surface color [done]
- Camera (and target) position of perspective views [partially done]
- Sun position
- Displacement sets [under review]
- Phases
- ...
 
##Installation
Installation is simple - just use Dynamo's built-in package manager and search for ```Dynanimator```.
Please note that this package has dependencies - during installation it will also install the package ```Clockwork```.

##Collaborate
